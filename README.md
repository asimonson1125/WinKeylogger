# WinKeylogger
This is a Windows keylogger based off a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-create-an-advanced-keylogger-from-scratch-for-windows/) I was in a while back. 

It's a little old, so the powershell script it uses to send mail doesn't work anymore. Because of that obviously important missing feature, this will put the results in a txt file.
Other than that, the only change I made was to remove the brackets around each letter and number (and turn "[SPACE]" into " ") for readability.


Of course, this is entirely for educational purposes and should not be used with malicious intent.  Follow the law, don't do drugs, and stay in school.
