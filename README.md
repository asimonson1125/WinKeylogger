# WinKeylogger
This is a Windows keylogger based off a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-create-an-advanced-keylogger-from-scratch-for-windows/) I was in a while back.  There is currently no major change to it, but if I do change it significantly, I will make note of it here.

Of course, this is entirely for educational purposes and should not be used with malicious intent.  Follow the law, don't do drugs, and stay in (online) school.
